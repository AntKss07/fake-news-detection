# Fake News Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning–based Fake News Detection system designed to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using their textual content. The primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of natural language processing techniques in identifying misinformation patterns in written news.

The project focuses on correctness, reproducibility, and clarity rather than production deployment.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a supervised learning model capable of distinguishing fake news from real news articles by learning linguistic and structural patterns present in text data.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Collection of labeled news articles
   - Separation into training and testing sets

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing and noise removal
   - Tokenization and vector representation

3. **Model Training**
   - Training a classification model on processed text data
   - Learning decision boundaries for fake vs real news

4. **Evaluation**
   - Performance testing on unseen data
   - Analysis using standard evaluation metrics

5. **Prediction**
   - Classifies new input articles as Real or Fake

## 📊 Observations

The model demonstrates the ability to identify fake news based on textual patterns. Accuracy and reliability vary depending on dataset quality, preprocessing choices, and data diversity.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Performance is dataset-dependent  
- Limited handling of satire or ambiguous language  
- Not suitable for deployment without further validation  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Use larger and more diverse datasets  
- Improve text representation methods  
- Add model explainability  
- Extend to multilingual fake news detection
